### Added (program):
- The metaprotocol is now fully implemented.  
  netorcai is now heavily tested under continuous integration,
  all coverable code should now be covered.
- New `--delay-turns` command-line option to specify
  the minimum number of milliseconds between two consecutive turns.
- New interactive prompt.

### Changed (metaprotocol):
- `GAME_STARTS`:
  - The `data` field has been renamed `initial_game_state`.
  - `player_id`: the "null" player_id is now represented as -1 (was `null`).
  - New `milliseconds_between_turns` field (minimum amount of milliseconds
    between two consecutive turns).
  - New `players_info` array used to forward information about the
    players to visualization clients.
- `GAME_ENDS`:
  - - The `data` field has been renamed `game_state`.
  - `winner_player_id`: the "null" player_id is now represented as -1
    (was `null`).
- `TURN`:
  - New `players_info` array used to forward information about the
    players to visualization clients.
- The `DO_FIRST_TURN` message type has been renamed `DO_INIT`
- New `DO_INIT_ACK` message (game logic initialization).
- `DO_TURN_ACK` : New `winner_player_id` field, which represents the current
  leader of the game (if any).

### Fixed:
- Various fixes, as the metaprotocol was not implemented yet â€” and therefore
  not tested.
